Project done at NYU Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, supervised by [Prof. Wilson Tam](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/yik-cheung-wilson-tam).

This is an implementation of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback using HuggingFace TRL. I used this codebase to train Llama-7b and Llama-13b on Anthrophic's [HH-RLHF](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/hh-rlhf) dataset and Jeremy Scheurer et al.'s [summarization](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JeremyAlain/SLF5K) dataset.
